Hi, I'm f1uffy. I named myself this after my cat, who's extremely fluffy (not the one in my profile pic, that's a different one of my cats). It started out as f1uffyCatsAreCute (because theu are), but eventually I decided to shorten it.

I mostly use Python, but I also know a good bit of JavaScript. Currently, I'm mostly working on a Rocket League bot called Nebula with @Octacore4F.

Oh, also, liking dogs more than cats should illegal; get on it, lawmakers!
